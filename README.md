# Swift6Concurrency
Core Components of the App Design

## Supported Platforms
Only iOS is supported platform 

## Min requirements
As the sample is to show the Swift6 concurrency in user.

### App Architecture
I will using MVVM to demo the Enterprise app development. It is a well known architecture in the dev community and it suits the SwiftUI needs. 
 
### Dependency Injection
Using the Factory package to manage the project dependencies. You can find the package details here https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory
 
 ### House keeping
 1. Use Swift lint to force styling and conventions in your code. you can read more on https://swiftpackageindex.com/realm/SwiftLint about this package. I have left some of the warnings as it is for swift lint to demo that swift lint is working :)
